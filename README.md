Terraform Infrastructure as Code - Coding Challenge

Overview
This repository provides the solution to the DevOps coding challenge, provisioning AWS infrastructure with Terraform. 
The implementation focuses on a clean, modular design with parameterized and reusable code to ensure flexibility, scalability, 
and ease of maintenance.

Requirements Addressed:
-   VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
-   Three public subnets across different Availability Zones
-   Three private subnets across different Availability Zones
-   Public instances have internet access, private subnets do not
-   EC2 instance provisioned in a public subnet
-   Security Group configured to allow HTTP (port 80)
-   Terraform modules created for reusability
-   Clean commit history to demonstrate thought process
